# ML_Projects Details

# **1. ML Models for Credit Card fraud detection:**
# **Dataset** 
- Sample Credit card fraud detection dataset contains total 284807 transaction which has 492 fraudelent transactions.
- These transactions done by European cardholders in September 2013
- Dataset features 31 anonymized variables derived from PCA, focusing on transaction details like time, amount, and transformed components (V1-V28).
- Dataset contains details: distance_from_home	distance_from_last_transaction	ratio_to_median_purchase_price	repeat_retailer	used_chip	used_pin_number	online_order	fraud which used for ML model building
# **ML model Building**
- The goal is to build models that can accurately distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions using these features, essential for enhancing financial transaction security and fraud prevention measures
